## I love build things and solving problems

I am a highly skilled software engineer with over 7 years of experience in building rich interactive web applications. With a strong focus on usability, accessibility, and inclusivity, I specialize in translating interaction design and product concepts into immersive experiences for end users.

As a tech lead and senior frontend developer, I have a proven track record in driving successful frontend architecture, implementing design systems, and creating component libraries. I excel in JavaScript/TypeScript development and possess commercial experience with all modern front-end frameworks such as React, Angular and Ionic. My understanding of HTML and CSS semantics, allows me to solve various business problems and cater to diverse user needs.

Adopting a DevOps mindset, I have successfully improved continuous integration pipelines on platforms like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Jenkins. Test automation is a passion of mine, and I have helped teams enhance their QA processes through effective testing strategies and utilizing tools such as Jest, Jasmine, Cypress and Storybook.

As a team player and mentor, I am committed to building a healthy team culture that values clean, modular and loosely coupled code. I excel at problem-solving, creating flexible and maintainable software architectures, and implementing SOLID principles and design patterns.
